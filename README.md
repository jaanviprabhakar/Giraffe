Visual Studio is an IDE unlike the commonly used Visual Studio Code, which is just an open source code editor.
An integrated development environment (IDE) is software for building applications that combines common developer tools into a single graphical user interface (GUI).

.NET Framework is the original implementation of .NET. It supports running websites, services, desktop apps, and more on Windows.

The Common Language Runtime (CLR) is the execution engine that handles running applications. 
It provides services like thread management, garbage collection, type-safety, exception handling, and more.
The Class Library provides a set of APIs and types for common functionality. It provides types for strings, dates, numbers, etc. 
The Class Library includes APIs for reading and writing files, connecting to databases, drawing, and more.

.NET applications are written in the C#, F#, or Visual Basic programming language. 
Code is compiled into a language-agnostic Common Intermediate Language (CIL). 
Compiled code is stored in assemblies—files with a .dll or .exe file extension.

When an app runs, the CLR takes the assembly and uses a just-in-time compiler (JIT) to turn it into machine code that can execute on the specific architecture of the computer it is running on.
